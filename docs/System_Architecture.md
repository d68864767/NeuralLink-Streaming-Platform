# System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for the NeuralLink Streaming Platform. The platform is built using Node.js and leverages advanced AI to interpret and stream neural data.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a structured directory layout to manage different aspects of the application. Here is a brief overview of the directory structure:

- `src/`: Contains all the source files for the application.
- `test/`: Contains the test suite for the application.
- `public/`: Contains publicly accessible files.
- `views/`: Contains view templates.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation.
- `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts for setup and deployment.

## Server Configuration

The server configuration is managed in the `src/config/server.js` file. The server is built using Express.js and includes middleware for security, compression, logging, CORS, and request body parsing. The server port is set from an environment variable or defaults to 3000.

## Database Configuration

The database configuration is managed in the `src/config/database.js` file. The application uses MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the ODM. The database connection string and options are set from environment variables.

## Logging

Logging is handled by the `src/utils/logger.js` file. The application uses the Winston library for logging. Logs are output to the console and also saved to files.

## Error Handling

Error handling is managed in the `src/utils/errorHandler.js` file. The error handler is a middleware function that logs the error and sends an error response to the client.

## API Controllers

The API controllers are located in the `src/api/controllers/` directory. The `streamController.js` file handles requests related to data streaming. The `userController.js` file manages user interactions.

## Neural Network Models

The neural network models are located in the `src/neuralNetworks/models/` directory. The `brainInterfaceModel.js` file defines the brain interface model. The `dataProcessingModel.js` file defines the data processing model.

## Services

The services are located in the `src/services/` directory. The `streamingService.js` file handles the streaming logic. The `userService.js` file manages user-related services.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are stored in the `.env` file. This file contains configuration for the server, database, and security.

## Testing

The test suite is located in the `test/` directory. The suite includes both integration tests and unit tests.

## Documentation

The project documentation is located in the `docs/` directory. This includes API documentation, a user manual, and a detailed system architecture document.

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts for setup and deployment.

## Public Files

The `public/` directory contains publicly accessible files, including CSS stylesheets, client-side JavaScript, and the main HTML file.

## View Templates

The `views/` directory contains view templates for the application.

## Conclusion

The NeuralLink Streaming Platform is a complex application with a well-structured architecture. The application leverages advanced AI and real-time data streaming to provide insights into brain-computer interfaces.
