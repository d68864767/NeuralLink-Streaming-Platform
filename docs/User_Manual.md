## Installation

To install the NeuralLink Streaming Platform, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. Once you have these prerequisites, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuralLinkStreamingPlatform.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd NeuralLinkStreamingPlatform`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the environment variables. These are located in the `.env` file at the root of the project. Here's what each variable means:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `DB_HOST`: The host of your MongoDB database.
- `DB_USER`: The username for your MongoDB database.
- `DB_PASS`: The password for your MongoDB database.
- `DB_NAME`: The name of your MongoDB database.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for signing and verifying JWT tokens for user authentication.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file. You can now interact with the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.

Here are some of the main API endpoints:

- `POST /api/stream/start`: Starts the data streaming.
- `POST /api/stream/stop`: Stops the data streaming.
- `POST /api/user/register`: Registers a new user.
- `POST /api/user/login`: Logs in a user.

For a full list of API endpoints, refer to the API documentation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the NeuralLink Streaming Platform, please refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

- **Server not starting:** Check the console for any error messages. Make sure the MongoDB server is running and the connection details in the `.env` file are correct.
- **API not responding:** Check the server logs for any error messages. Make sure the server is running and listening on the correct port.
- **Other issues:** For any other issues, please refer to the project's GitHub issues page or contact the project maintainers.

Thank you for using the NeuralLink Streaming Platform. We hope this user manual helps you in setting up and using the platform effectively.
